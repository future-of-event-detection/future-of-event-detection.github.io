            <h2>Workshop Description</h2>
            <p>
                In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the amount of publicly-generated digital data. One prominent category of this data, and arguably the largest in terms of daily generation, pertains to various real-world events, ranging from natural disasters to political occurrences to sports events. Detecting these events serves various crucial purposes, including early warning systems, emergency response, situational awareness, tracking public health trends, and understanding societal shifts, among others. However, automatic real-time event detection presents intriguing challenges, primarily stemming from the characteristics of the data. These challenges include the diversity of public online data (multimodal nature), the rapid pace at which data is produced (velocity), the sheer volume of data generated, and the reliability of the data (veracity).  Moreover, the recent advancements in powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI Systems offer new opportunities to revise event detection pipelines, enabling novel approaches and applications across various domains.  The workshop focuses on:

                The workshop focuses on:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Looking forward and looking back</b>: The workshop will solicit ideas on how the field of event detection should evolve over the next twenty years, as well as solicit papers reflecting on what has worked and not worked in the field thus far.</li>
                    <li><b>Expanding Beyond NLP</b>:  As noted above, there are many sibling areas that actively research event detection. Many of these areas have remained siloed and there is not much cross communication though they are working on similar problem areas. This workshop seeks to address this by actively soliciting research and invited speakers from these areas.</li>
                    <li><b>Theory to Application</b>: Finally, this workshop will emphasize how event detection technology can be used in real-world applications.</li>
                </ul>

                We solicited novel papers, including, but not limited to the following topics: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Position and opinion papers on the state and future of event detection</li>
                    <li>Retrospectives</li>

                    <p><strong>Title:</strong>Event Detection: Something Olde and Something New</p>
                    <p>
                        When the first event detection shared task was launched at the Message Understanding 
                        Conference (MUC-5) in 1993, building a system to detect just one event type in one language 
                        took a month of development. Thirty years later, we’ve seen remarkable progress: modern event 
                        detection systems can identify over 3,000 event types across hundreds of languages and multiple data modalities—including text, speech, images, and video. These systems now offer much higher accuracy, coverage, and portability, all at a fraction of the original cost, pushing the 
                        boundaries of what’s possible in areas like disaster management, business analytics, decision 
                        support, and beyond. While these advancements are impressive, the exciting potential lies ahead.

                        In this talk, I will not only revisit the key techniques that have driven event detection forward but
                        also explore what the next decades could hold in the era of large language models (LLMs). I will
                        propose several PhD dissertation-worthy research directions that could shape the future of event detection, such as never-ending event knowledge base construction, event-based LLM
                        knowledge updating, corpus-level complex event detection and analysis, multimodal event
                        detection and knowledge integration, and emerging applications in situation understanding,
                        hypothesis generation, simulation, and predictive analytics.

                    <p><strong>Title:</strong>Detecting pivotal shifts during complex wildfires: hazards, incident response, community impacts and community response
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The impacts of wildfires are intensifying in the United States due to a combination of a warming climate, policies and practices contributing to a long-term buildup of fuels on the landscape and housing practices that continue to put more people in harm’s way. Teasing apart and making sense of these contributing factors poses numerous challenges for researchers, land managers, and incident management organizations struggling to assess both our current situation and viable paths forward. Recent advances in natural language and data synthesis techniques are a critical component of making sense of this critical moment in time.
                        In this talk I will present current research as part of the CU Earth Lab Wildfire Research Team and collaboration with the USDA Forest Service Wildfire Risk Management Science Team, Human Dimensions Lab to make progress in some of the most critical areas.

                        Lise is a research scientist at Earth Lab responsible for the Global Social Sensing Project, a research initiative to develop datasets Earth scale related to the societal impact and societal disruption of natural hazard events for use in Earth Sciences, natural hazards research, and for real-time response applications.
                        Lise has a multidisciplinary background in computer science, data science, human-centered design, crisis informatics, emergency response, and natural hazards research. She holds degrees in Computer Science, Human-centered computing and brings over a decade of industry software design and development experience to her academic research role. 
                        Her doctoral research focused on the challenges of integrating social media into formal emergency response and as part of this research participated in over forty emergency response activations with the Virtual Operational Support Team (VOST) community. Her current research extends that knowledge into the Earth Analytics domain, finding new methods for capturing information related to emergency response and societal impacts at scale for use in Earth sciences and natural hazards research. Related work includes development of the ICS-209-PLUS dataset: a geo-spatial, research grade dataset combining daily snapshots of incident response, hazard characteristics and societal impacts. Design of a neural net classifier for organizing social media for emergency response and natural hazards research.
                        In her free time, Lise loves using her art and design skills, spending time with family and hiking in Boulder County open space with her dogs. She is still an active member of the VOST community and co-lead for the PNWVOST Team.

            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Previously published papers cannot be accepted. </li>
                    <li>The submissions will be reviewed by the program committee. </li>
                    <li>As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. </li>
                    <li>Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".</li>
                    <li>Please note that unlike EMNLP, which uses ARR for submission management, we will be using the START conference system. </li>
